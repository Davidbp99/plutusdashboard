Open source project for personal dashboard. Others can access it by going to https://davidbp99.github.io/plutusdashboard/


This is not made by request on plutus or any of its staffs. I'm using the public api I could track down via the browsers own api requests and from self poking few APIs to look at responds.

https://davidbp99.github.io/plutusdashboard/giftcardsonly/ <- if you only want to look at the giftcards. No auth needed
